<!-- This comes from the navsat_transform_template.launch. Explains what this node does.
     This node needs to know the values of three variables in order to function:
     (1) A world-referenced heading (yaw). The node assumes an ENU standard for heading, with 0 facing east, though
         it can support any heading.
     (2) Odometry data that gives the robot's current pose in its own local coordinate frame (typically map or odom)
     (3) A latitude/longitude/altitude.
     These three items allow us to compute a transform from the global frame to your robot's local frame. There are
     several means of providing them, though keep in mind that these modes are typically mutually exclusive.
     (1) World-referenced yaw can be provided by:
           (a) an IMU in a sensor_msgs/Imu message (topic is /imu/data/)
           (b) the heading in the nav_msgs/Odometry message in (2) below can be used. To enable this behavior, set
               the use_odometry_yaw parameter to true, and set the delay parameter to some small value (~3 seconds).
               Be careful, though: this heading must still be globally referenced, so if your state estimation node
               always starts with a 0 heading, you CAN NOT use this option.
           (c) the "datum" service. See below.
     (2) The odometry data, which needs to have a valid frame_id, can be provided by:
           (a) a nav_msgs/Odometry message from your robot_localization state estimation node.
           (b) the "datum" service (all odometry variables are assumed to be 0 in this case). See below.
     (3) The latitude, longitude, and altitude can be provided by:
           (a) a sensor_msgs/NavSatFix message
           (b) the "datum" service
     (4) Alternatively, at any time, the user can send a robot_localization/SetDatum service message to the "datum" service. 
         This will manually set the latitude, longitude, altitude, and world-referenced heading, and will assume an odometry 
         message containing all zeros. This will effectively set the origin at the specified lat-long, with the X-axis
         aligned with east. The user can set this datum via the "datum" service, or via the launch file. If the wait_for_datum
         parameter is set to true, then the node will attempt to use the datum parameter. If the parameter is not set, it will
         wait until it receives a service call.
     The output of this node is an odometry message that contains the GPS data transformed into the robot's world coordinate
     frame (i.e., the frame specified by input (2)'s frame_id), or the coordinate frame defined by the message sent to the
     "datum" service.
