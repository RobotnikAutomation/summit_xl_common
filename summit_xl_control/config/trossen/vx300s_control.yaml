# The gripper has two claws that are not mechanically independent. When one 
# moves 0.1, the other moves -0.1. Therefore, both claws must be managed by 
# a single controller. However, the manufacturer has not provided a specific
# controller. For the simulation the manufacturer has assumed that each gripper
# is controlled independently. This is not correct because different positions
# from reality are generated. For the real robot only the left claw is controlled.
# The right claw is managed through its hardware interface.
